# CCDP
CoffeeChain Data Platform
###
# Project Goal
Design and implement an MVP data platform for analytics of a coffee shop chain.
The platform is built on top of a legacy CRM data model ([DoubleB](https://github.com/withapoll/DoubleB)) and provides
batch data ingestion, transformation, and analytical data modeling.
# Data Source


Database schema is based on my previous CRM application (DoubleB), built with Vue.js and Supabase
Data is synthetically generated to simulate real production workloads.
# MVP-arhitecture
PostgreSQL (CRM source)
    → Python ingestion (batch)
    → Raw layer (Parquet files)
    → PySpark transformations
    → Curated layer
    → Snowflake (data warehouse)
    → Analytical queries
# Stack
- Python
- SQL
- PostgreSQL
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Apache Airflow
- Snowflake
# Roadmap
- [x] Restore CRM database schema
- [ ] Generate synthetic production-like data
- [ ] Implement batch ingestion
- [ ] Implement Spark transformations
- [ ] Build analytical data model in Snowflake
- [ ] Orchestrate pipelines with Airflow
